I developed a Power BI project using a real dataset from a Professional Breakdown Data Survey.

Throughout the process, I focused on thorough data cleaning and organization to ensure accurate and efficient analysis.

Once the dataset was properly structured, I dedicated special attention to enhancing the visual design — aiming for clear, intuitive, and visually appealing dashboards that maximize readability and interpretation.



This project was created entirely using Power BI Desktop, and I included two examples showing the visual transformation — before and after — to highlight the improvement in layout and data storytelling.
